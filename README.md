# NYC CitiBike Bikesharing

## Overview of the Analysis

This project is intended to analyze bikesharing data and provide visualizations to potential investors.  Pandas was used to change the "tripduration" column from integer to a datetime datatype. Then the converted data was connected to Tableau to produce vivid visualizations producing patterns and trends consisting of gender, birth year, ride times and length, and location of stations.

## Results

### Trips by Birth Year

Over 237,000 trips were taken by customers born in 1969.


### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

5:00-7:00 PM on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays are the busiest times with male riders leading the way.


### Trips by Gender by Weekday

Thursday is the busiest day of the week with male subscribers taking the most trips.


### Trips by Weekday per Hour

1:00 - 5:00 AM are the slowest times throughout the week, with Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays from 5:00 - 7:00 PM being the busiest along with 5:00 - 6:00 PM on Fridays.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

The Midtown East region of Manhattan has the busiest starting location with over 16,500 trips.


### Check Out Times for Users

5 minutes trips are the most popular duration with over 147,500 rides.


### Check Out Times by Gender

The most popular trip duration among males is 5 minutes and the most popular among women is 6 minutes.


## Summary

The analysis shows that males are frequent users of CitiBike, along with adults around 52 years of age.  Marketing should be geared towards this demographic.  The results also show that the slowest times are between 1:00 - 5:00 AM which would be a great time for bike maintenance.  The count of trips per station can also aid strategically supplying bikes where needed.
