# NYC CitiBike Bikesharing

## Overview of the Analysis

This project is intended to analyze bikesharing data and provide visualizations to potential investors.  Pandas was used to change the "tripduration" column from integer to a datetime datatype. Then the converted data was connected to Tableau to produce vivid visualizations producing patterns and trends consisting of gender, birth year, ride times and length, and location of stations.

## Results

### Trips by Birth Year

Over 237,000 trips were taken by customers born in 1969.

## Summary

The analysis shows that males are frequent users of CitiBike, along with adults around 52 years of age.  Marketing should be geared towards this demographic.  The results also show that the slowest times are between 1:00 - 5:00 AM which would be a great time for bike maintenance.  The count of trips per station can also aid strategically supplying bikes where needed.
